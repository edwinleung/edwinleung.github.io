  <br>While I was creating my portfolio, I wanted it to show off my personality.
  I could simply write a paragraph about myself, but I wanted to achieve this
  goal in a creative manner. Thus, I was inspired to create a logo that could
  help viewers better understand who I am as a person.<br><br><br><br><p
  style="margin-left: 40px">If I were to introduce myself, what would I
  say?</p><br><br><br><br><p> I asked myself this question because I wanted the
  first interaction between my logo and viewer to reflect how I would interact
  with them in person.<br><br>My answer to this question would be to say my
  name. This got me thinking about my Chinese name: 梁子正<br><br>As I was looking
  at my Chinese name, I noticed that the last character resembled the letter
  "E". As I looked into that character, I found out that it can be translated to
  "positive".</p>
