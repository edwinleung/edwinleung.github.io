  <br>While I was creating my portfolio, I wanted it to show off my personality.
  I did not want viewers of my portfolio to judge me solely off of my work.
  Thus, I was inspired to create a logo that could help viewers better
  understand who I am as a person.<br><br>If I were to introduce myself to
  someone, what would I say?<br><br> I asked myself this question because I
  wanted the first interaction between my logo and viewer to reflect how I would
  interact with them in person.<br><br>My answer to this question would be to
  say my name. This got me thinking about my Chinese name: 梁子正
