  <br>Course registration in post-secondary education can be quite irritating
  when students cannot understand how it works. I myself have had difficulties
  with Laurier's course registration process and have always wanted to see how
  it can be improved. <br><br>The annual UX Design trip that Laurier has for
  its' students brought us to Bridgeable, where we were given the task of
  creating a journey map for course registration. Needless to say, I was
  thrilled.<br><br>We began by recalling our personal experiences with course
  registration, and creating five steps that it would take. Then, we split up
  the five steps amongst each other so that we could work on the rest of the
  journey map. This included supporting data and a user experience
  chart.<br><br>Even though we worked on separate stages, I would help my other
  members and receive help if we ever needed it.<br><br>The goal of the course
  registration journey map was not to solve the perceived problem, but rather
  come up with the actual problem.
