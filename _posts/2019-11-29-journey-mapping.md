  Course registration in post-secondary education can be quite irritating when
  students cannot understand how it works. I myself have had difficulties with
  Laurier's course registration process and have always wanted to see how it can
  be improved. <br><br>The annual UX Design trip that Laurier has for its'
  students brought us to Bridgeable, where we were given the task of creating a
  journey map for course registration. Needless to say, I was thrilled.<br><br>
