  <br>The prompt for this project was to design a website that would help
  explain user experience design in a field of my choice.<br><br>UX-MU was
  inspired by two of my passions: design and music. By choosing two fields that
  I am passionate about, I knew that I would be able to work productively.
  <br><br>To start off, I created a project scope and plan to ensure that my
  stages of design would meet my deadline. Then, I began to do some competitive
  analysis to gain a better understanding of who might my potential users would
  be. <br><br>I created multiple low-medium fidelity prototypes in order to
  visualize my ideas and to use them for user testing.
