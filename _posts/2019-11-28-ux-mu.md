  <br>The prompt for this project was to design a website that would help
  explain user experience design in a field of my choice.<br><br>UX-MU was
  inspired by two of my passions: design and music. By choosing two fields that
  I am passionate about, I knew that I would be able to work productively. In
  every stage of the design process, I made sure to design for my users, and not
  for myself. <br><br>I began my research with a project scope and plan to
  ensure that my stages of design would meet my deadline. Then, I began to do a
  competitive analysis to gain a better understanding of who might my potential
  users would be. I also conducted user interviews and an open card sort to
  better understand how my users might think. <br><br> My steps moving forward
  included creating multiple low-medium fidelity prototypes. I began by
  sketching with pen and paper and eventually used Adobe XD to build
  higher-fidelity prototypes. These mockups were designed with the data I had
  collected through my user research. The prototypes were then used for user
  testing and continually iterated for improvement.
