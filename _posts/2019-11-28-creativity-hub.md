  <br>Market Square is an abandoned mall that was bought by Laurier Brantford
  for the development of the campus. I have always wondered what Laurier was
  going to do with the space because it is such a spacious building.
  <br><br>Design Thinking I connected my group with Laurier faculty members to
  re-design Market Square as a maker space for storytelling.<br><br>The first
  stage of research that we conducted was a brain-dump on the term
  "storytelling." This helped us remove any biases that we had when we moved
  onto our second stage of research: user interviews. We produced a small
  questionnaire and went around campus asking students from various programs
  what they would like to see in this potential space.<br><br>
